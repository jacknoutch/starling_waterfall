# Starling Waterfall

I use Starling's pots as a budgeting tool. It works great, but I get paid on the last working day of the month - which varies - whereas pots only allow for automatic transfers on set days of the month (I have mine set on the first of the month).

This program automates the process of transferring funds into my pots so that my wages don't sit in my main account balance until the first of the month.

## Plan

- The program is a CLI
- Its functionality should include:
- List of all current balances
- List of proposed waterfall transfers
- Automatic movement of next payment dates
- Quit!
