# Starling Waterfall

I use Starling's pots as a budgeting tool. It works great, but I get paid on the last working day of the month - which varies - whereas pots only allow for automatic transfers on set days of the month. This program automates the process of transferring funds into my pots so that my wages don't sit in my main account balance until the first of the month.
